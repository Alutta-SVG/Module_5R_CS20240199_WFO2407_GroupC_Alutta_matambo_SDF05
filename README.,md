For my custom buttons i decided to style them using transitions. To all of my buttons i added 2/3 colors that can be used during the transitio.
These colors include the box shadow colors and the colors that the buttons change to or add on when hovered over.
I then added the hover before and after pseudos that tell the buttons to change color and shape when hovered over.
The challenges i faced with this project was mostly with the colors, i struggled to get the exact color combinations i wanted.
